## Breakout tips
* Select a facilitator, a notetaker, a timekeeper, and a gatekeeper
  * a gatekeeper is an advocate for full participation in the session. Some duties of the gatekeeper are:
    * slowing the conversation at times to ensure everyone can participate
    * asking for clarification on acronyms, tooling names or other phrases so everyone understands the conversation
    * bringing any inappropriate/discriminatory behavior to duty officers for resolution
* Start with a problem statement or try to answer the following questions:
  * What do we do well?
  * What would you like to improve?
  * What are the desired deliverables?
  * What are our use cases?
